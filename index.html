            <li>Dynamax and Tera are currently ignored because they require plugins to function in Essentials.</li>
            <li>Happiness are Hidden Power are currently ignored because I didn't think they were important enough yet, and also Hidden Power has some differences between vanilla Essentials and Showdown.</li>

            <li>Note that form recognition isn't implemented yet, so for example you might get GOLEM-ALOLA as output. You'll need to remove -ALOLA and add Form = 1 yourself.</li>
            <li>IVs are not currently assumed to be maxed. You might want to add this line yourself: IV = 31,31,31,31,31,31</li>
